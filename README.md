# Project Overview

This project is designed following **Clean Architecture** and **Clean Code** principles. It emphasizes maintainability, testability, and separation of concerns across all layers.  

## Key Architectural Features

- **Domain Layer**: Contains business entities, value objects, domain events, and domain services.
- **Application Layer**: Encapsulates use cases and orchestrates interactions between domain and infrastructure.
- **Infrastructure Layer**: Implements repositories, external service integrations, and data access.
- **Presentation Layer**: Handles API endpoints, controllers, or user interfaces (if applicable).

## Design Principles

- **Clean Architecture**: Each layer depends only on layers closer to the domain, minimizing coupling.
- **Clean Code Practices**: Readable, self-documenting, and maintainable codebase.
- **SOLID Principles**: Ensures single responsibility, open-closed, Liskov substitution, interface segregation, and dependency inversion.
- **DDD Concepts**: Value Objects, Entities, Aggregates, Domain Events, and Specifications are applied where appropriate.

## Design Patterns Used

### GoF Patterns
- **Repository**: Abstracts data access logic from domain logic.
- **Specification**: Encapsulates complex query criteria.
- **Decorator**: Adds responsibilities to objects dynamically.
- **Chain of Responsibility**: Processes requests through a chain of handlers.
- **Unit of Work**: Manages transactional consistency across multiple operations.

### Other Useful Patterns
- **Result / Either**: Encapsulates success/failure results.
- **State Pattern**: Handles dynamic behavior changes based on entity state.
- **Value Object Pattern**: Encapsulates immutable domain values with validation.
- **Domain Event Pattern**: Captures and publishes domain events for decoupled communication.

**Note:** The projectâ€™s focus is on creating a maintainable, extensible, and highly testable architecture rather than on a specific business use case. However, it is designed with best practices in mind and could potentially be deployed to production if adapted to a real-world scenario.
